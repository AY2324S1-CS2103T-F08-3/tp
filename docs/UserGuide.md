# PawFection User Guide

PawFection is a **desktop app for managing animals in a pet shelter, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It aims to provide a platform for volunteers to store and retrieve information
about animals in a shelter easily.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `pawfection.jar`.

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your PawFection.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar pawfection.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/Pookie i/1234 db/28-2-2022 s/male b/Golden Retriver da/23-5-2022` : Adds a dog named 'Pookie' to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the animal with ID 3.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Pookie`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/NOTES]` can be used as `n/Pookie t/Aggressive towards DOGS` or as `n/Pookie`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/NOTES]…​` can be used as `t/friendly towards human`, `t/friendly towards human t/hates walking` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME db/DOB`, `db/DOB n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<box type="warning" seamless>
**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
